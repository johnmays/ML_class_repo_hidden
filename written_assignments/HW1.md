3. Describe two learning tasks that might be suitable for machine learning approaches. For each task, write down the goal, a possible performance measure, what examples you might get and what a suitable hypothesis space might be. Be original---don’t write about tasks discussed in class or described in the texts. Preferably select tasks from your research area (if any). Describe any aspect of the task(s) that may not fit well with the supervised learning setting and feature vector representation we have discussed.

# Note:
This is a clone of the private repository my group and I contributed to during the graduate ML class I took at my school.  I am keeping this repository public for a short amount of time to easily share with potential employers.  I have made edits and made certain things intentionally vague so that current students cannot track this repository down through any search engine and attempt to cheat with it.  If you are a student, then turn back.  The last person who used a repo of mine that was unintentionally left public to cheat at my former school was easily found out.
